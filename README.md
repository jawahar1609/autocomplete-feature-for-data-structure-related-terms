# AUTO-COMPLETE-FEATURE-FOR-DATA-STRUCTURE-RELATED-TERMS
This project is an attempt to implement the autocomplete feature for data structure-related terms using the trie data structure. Trie is an efficient information retrieval data structure. Trie data structure helps in bringing down the search complexities to an optimal level, which makes it more efficient for data retrieval. The program code is done in the Java programming language. We have also implemented a GUI with the help of the swing framework, to enhance the user interaction with the program. Apart from auto-suggestions display in the GUI window, the user has the functionality to insert and delete terms. Also, the information about the terms entered by the user will be displayed in the GUI, which has been implemented with the help of the JSoup library for web scrapping.
